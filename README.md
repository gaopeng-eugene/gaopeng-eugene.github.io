My name is Gao Peng, a second year of Ph.D. student at Chinese University of Hong Kong supervised by [Hongsheng Li](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/). Before that, I spent one year in Singapore, working with [Steven Hoi](http://stevenhoi.org/). I graduated from Zhe Jiang Univeristy.

My research interest is in Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning.
